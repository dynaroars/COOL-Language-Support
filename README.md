# COOL Language Support

## Overview
This extension aims to make COOL more accessible to those who are learning it, leverage the burden of repeated manual works. It can be installed from the [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Linhan.cool-language-support)!

It provides support for [COOL(Classroom Object Oriented Language)](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/software/cool/cool.html), a programming language designed by [Alexander Aiken](http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/) at Stanford. 




## Features:

- ### Static error checking
 This extension is connected with a COOL compiler backend that validates your program in real-time. 
 Whenever a lexical/syntax/typing error is made, an error message will be displayed.
